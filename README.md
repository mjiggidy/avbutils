trt_from_AVBs
=============

Calculate the TRT directly from your Avid project's Reel bins!  Kinda neat!

Obviously every project will be set up differently, but `trtlib` contains the tools you can assemble into what you need.

Usage for the example command-line program:

```bash
python3 examples/get_trts.py /path/to/binsfolder/ [--head 8:00] [--tail 4:00]
```
